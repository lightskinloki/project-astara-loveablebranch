# Infinite Procedural World Generator 🌍

An ambitious real-time infinite world generation system built with Phaser.js that creates endless, explorable environments with 100% procedurally generated assets.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project demonstrates the power of procedural generation by creating an infinite 2D world where every element - from terrain and vegetation to structures and items - is generated algorithmically in real-time as players explore. No pre-made assets are used; everything is created through code using mathematical algorithms and noise functions.

## ✨ Features

### 🌱 Infinite World Generation
- **Seamless Exploration**: Walk in any direction forever - the world generates chunks dynamically
- **Biome Diversity**: Multiple biomes (forests, deserts, mountains, plains) with smooth transitions
- **Persistent Chunks**: Previously explored areas are saved and remain consistent
- **Performance Optimized**: Efficient chunk loading/unloading system maintains smooth gameplay

### 🎨 Procedural Asset Generation
- **Terrain Generation**: Multi-octave Perlin noise creates realistic height maps and cave systems
- **Vegetation Systems**: Algorithmically placed trees, bushes, grass, and flowers based on biome rules
- **Structural Generation**: Villages, ruins, dungeons, and landmarks spawned using spatial algorithms
- **Resource Distribution**: Ores, water sources, and special materials placed via probability matrices

### 🎮 Dynamic Gameplay Elements
- **Weather Systems**: Procedural weather patterns affect visibility and gameplay
- **Day/Night Cycles**: Dynamic lighting with realistic shadows and ambient changes
- **Wildlife Spawning**: Creatures generated based on biome type and environmental factors
- **Interactive Elements**: Harvestable resources, discoverable secrets, and emergent storytelling

## 🛠 Technical Implementation

### Core Technologies
- **Phaser 3**: Primary game engine for rendering and physics
- **Simplex/Perlin Noise**: Terrain and feature generation algorithms
- **Spatial Hashing**: Efficient chunk management and entity lookup
- **Web Workers**: Background generation to maintain frame rates
- **Canvas API**: Custom asset rendering and texture generation

### Generation Pipeline
1. **Chunk Request**: Player movement triggers new chunk generation
2. **Heightmap Creation**: Noise functions generate base terrain elevation
3. **Biome Assignment**: Temperature/humidity maps determine biome types
4. **Feature Placement**: Structures and vegetation placed using rule sets
5. **Asset Rendering**: All sprites generated programmatically via canvas
6. **Chunk Optimization**: Generated content optimized for rendering performance

### Procedural Asset Systems

#### 🌳 Vegetation Generator
```javascript
// Trees generated with fractal branching algorithms
// Leaves created using particle-like distribution
// Colors derived from biome and seasonal parameters
```

#### 🏠 Structure Generator  
```javascript
// Buildings use modular component assembly
// Architectural styles vary by biome and culture
// Interior layouts generated using space-filling algorithms
```

#### ⛰️ Terrain Renderer
```javascript
// Multi-layer noise creates realistic landscapes
// Erosion simulation adds natural weathering
// Cave systems use 3D noise projected to 2D
```

## 🎯 Key Algorithms

### World Generation
- **Diamond-Square Algorithm**: Creates natural-looking terrain elevation
- **Voronoi Diagrams**: Generates distinct biome regions with natural borders
- **Wave Function Collapse**: Ensures coherent structure and object placement
- **L-Systems**: Creates realistic tree and plant growth patterns

### Performance Optimization
- **Frustum Culling**: Only renders visible chunks and objects
- **Level of Detail (LOD)**: Distant objects use simplified representations
- **Object Pooling**: Reuses game objects to minimize garbage collection
- **Async Generation**: Non-blocking world creation maintains smooth gameplay
